# UX
 
### Who this website is for:
* This website is for customers / potential customers of the Green Kitchen Cafe chain.

### What they want to achieve:
* They want to learn more about Green Kitchen Cafe, read the menus on offer, find the cafe location closest to them and potentially book a table.

### This project is the best way to help them achieve these things because:
* The website is easy to navigate and uses a clear layout to display each of the above items.


## User Stories:
1.	As a user, I want to learn more about the café, and read some background information to get a feel for the company.
2.	As a user, I want to read through the menus on offer at the café.
3.	As a user, I want to see where the cafes are located on a map.
4.	As a user, I want to be able to be able to contact the company to reserve a table.


## Design 
- Color Scheme - I decided on using a green and white color scheme for the webpage to convey a sense of balance, health and simplicity. These connotations tie in with the business model of the company.
    - #4A8646 - 'Middle Green'  
    - #F0FAEF - 'Mint Cream'
    - #F5F5F5 - 'Cultured'
    - #9BE89B - 'Granny Smith Apple' 

- Typography 
    - I chose the Google Font 'Chilanka' for the main font of the page. I chose this everyday handwriting style as it ties in with the casual style of the business.
